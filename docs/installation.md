## Vgridtools installation
Vgrid Plugin requires the [vgrid](https://pypi.org/project/vgrid/) Python package to work properly.
This means that before you can use the plugin, you must ensure that the vgrid package is installed in the Python environment that QGIS is using.

How you install vgrid depends on the type of QGIS installation you are using:

### OSGeo4W QGIS
Open OSGeo4W Shell and run the following command before (or after) installing Vgrid Plugin
```
pip install vgrid --upgrade
```

### Standalone QGIS
After installing Vgrid Plugin, a dialog will appear prompting you to install `vgrid`. Copy the following commands
```python
import pip  
pip.main(['install', 'vgrid','--upgrade'])
```
